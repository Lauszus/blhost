 * \brief Abstract base class for the target address or range of data.
 *
 * Targets at the most basic level have a single address, and potentially
 * an address range. Unbounded targets have a beginning address but no
 * specific end address, while bounded targets do have an end address.
 *
 * Users of a data target can access the begin and end addresses directly.
 * However, the most powerful way to use a target is with the
 * getRangeForSegment() method. This method returns the target address range
 * for a segment of a data source. The value of the resulting range can be
 * completely dependent upon the segment's properties, those of its data
 * source, and the type of data target.
 *
 * \see blfwk::DataSource
